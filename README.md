<hr>

A decentralized oekaki (お絵描き, jp. drawing) BBS running as an [AT Protocol AppView](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#app-view).

It allows you to log in with your AT Protocol account and draw right in the browser using a modified variant of the [tegaki.js](https://github.com/desuwa/tegaki) editor! Your images are stored on your ATProto Personal Data Server, meaning that no PinkSea instance actually controls them. If one goes down, another one can take its place. You are in full control of everything you draw.

Other than just drawing, PinkSea allows you to tag your oekaki, grouping them together like in sites akin to Pixiv. PinkSea also permits responding with oekaki to other oekaki!

# Running (Docker)

In order to run PinkSea as a Docker container, you need to have the [Docker runtime](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

1. Clone this repository by doing `git clone https://github.com/shinolabs/PinkSea`

2. Navigate to the cloned repository.

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify the settings according to your setup.

4. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the containers and detach from them.

5. (Initial run only) Wait for PinkSea to finish backfilling all the oekaki posts.

Your PinkSea instance will now be accessible at the `FRONTEND_URL` endpoint you've specified for it, fully connected with the entire ATProto network! Simple as that!

## Updating

1. Run `docker compose down` to shut down the containers.

2. Run `git pull` to fetch the latest changes to the repository.

2. Run `docker compose up -d --build` to force rebuild all the PinkSea dockerfiles.

Your PinkSea instance should now be up-to-date!

# Running (Manual)

## Backend (AppView)

In order to run the AppView, you need the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) and the Entity Framework tools package, which you can install through `dotnet tools -g install dotnet-ef`.

### First-time run

1. Open the `PinkSea` folder
2. Copy the sample `appsettings.example.json` file to `appsettings.json`
	
	1. Modify the `PostgresConfig` to point to your PostgreSQL settings.
	2. Point the `AppViewConfig` URL to where your AppView will reside, this is the URL that will be used to identify your PinkSea instance. (As an example, for the official PinkSea instance, it's `https://api.pinksea.art`)
	3. (OPTIONAL) Point the `FrontendConfig` to point to where your PinkSea frontend resides. This is used for BlueSky cross-posting with a link. Leaving it blank will disallow cross-posting. (Again, as an example, for the official PinkSea instance it's `https://pinksea.art`)

3. Run `dotnet run --configuration Release` to start the PinkSea AppView. PinkSea will automatically perform migrations.

That's it! Your server now is connected to the ATmosphere and is ready to start cooperating with other PinkSea AppViews.

### Updating

1. Navigate to the `PinkSea` folder.
2. Run `dotnet ef database update` to run the migrations.
3. Once again, run `dotnet run --configuration Release` to start the server in Release mode.

## Frontend (Client app)

In order to run the client app locally, you need a fairly modern [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version. Anything above Node 20 works, but I personally recommend the latest LTS version.

### Configuration

1. Navigate to `PinkSea.Frontend`.
2. Run `npm i` to download the required packages.
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
4. Set `VITE_PINKSEA_API_URL` to your AppView instance. (For example, for the official PinkSea instance, the endpoint is `https://api.pinksea.art`)

### Running a local server

1. Navigate to `PinkSea.Frontend`
2. Run `npm i` to update the packages.
3. Finally, execute `npm run dev`, to start a local development server with code reloading.

### Building

1. Navigate to `PinkSea.Frontend`
2. Run `npm i` to update the packages.
3. Finally, execute `npm run build`, to build and minify the client app.

The built app will be inside of the `dist` folder.

## Gateway (SSR helpers for the frontend)

### Configuration

1. Open the `PinkSea.Gateway` folder.
2. Copy the sample `appsettings.example.json` file to `appsettings.json`
3. Edit the values inside of it
	
	1. Point `AppViewEndpoint` URL to where your AppView resides. (As an example, for the official PinkSea instance, it's `https://api.pinksea.art`).
	2. Point `FrontEndEndpoint` URL to where your frontend will reside. (As an example, for the official PinkSea instance, it's `https://pinksea.art`).

4. Create the `wwwroot` folder.
5. Copy the built frontend from `PinkSea.Frontend/dist` to `wwwroot`
6. Run `dotnet run --configuration Release` to start the PinkSea gateway helper.
